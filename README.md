# 🚀 Carbon - Autonomous AI Backend for Worker Pooled Insurance

Carbon is a production-grade, event-driven financial insurance backend designed for modern gig-worker ecosystems (Delivery partners, Ride-share drivers, and Freelancers). It automates the entire micro-insurance lifecycle—from real-time disruption detection to idempotent, zero-human-intervention payouts.

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Industrial Context

### The Problem: Vulnerable Gig Worker Ecosystems
Traditional insurance models fail gig workers because:
1.  **High Friction**: Claim processing takes days; workers need cash in minutes.
2.  **Manual Verification**: Human auditing of weather or platform disruptions is slow and expensive.
3.  **Flat Pricing**: Premiums don't adjust to dynamic environmental or behavioral risks.

### The Solution: Carbon's Autonomous Orchestration
Carbon solves this using a **Centralized Orchestration Engine** (`OrchestrationEngine`) that monitors external disruptions and triggers a chain of events across 13 specialized microservices.

## 🔒 Authentication & Global Request Standards

Carbon uses **JWT-based Bearer Authentication**. All protected endpoints require an `Authorization` header.

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <access_token>` |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |

## 🔄 The Autonomous Insurance Lifecycle (Step-by-Step)

The beauty of Carbon is its zero-touch automation. Here is how it works under the hood:

1.  **Ingestion**: The `trigger_service` polls external weather sensors.
2.  **Detection**: If precipitation > 15mm/hr is detected in "MR-1", a `WEATHER_DISRUPTION` event is created.
3.  **Orchestration**: The `OrchestrationEngine` starts a background task.
4.  **Identification**: It queries the `Worker` service for all workers currently active in "MR-1".
5.  **Eligibility**: The `EligibilityService` verifies which identified workers have an ACTIVE `Policy`.
6.  **Mass-Claims**: A `Claim` is generated for every eligible worker at a fixed "Disruption Payout" rate ($500).
7.  **Fraud Check**: The `FraudService` cross-verifies worker GPS pings during the rain period.
8.  **Settlement**: Upon approval, the `PayoutService` triggers a settlement and the `Ledger` records a `DEBIT` from the `Pool`.
9.  **Notification**: The worker receives a "Disruption Payout Processed" SMS immediately.

## 🤖 Autonomous Orchestration Deep-Dive

Carbon's defining feature is its **zero-touch automation**. The system is designed to run continuously in the background, making financial decisions without human intervention.

### 1. The Autonomous "Ear" (`background_monitor`)
Located in `app/services/orchestration_service.py`, the `background_monitor` is a resilient polling task that:
- **Polls Every 60s**: Checks for real-time weather and platform disruptions.
- **Exponential Backoff**: If external APIs or the database fail, the monitor gracefully slows down retries (5s -> 10s -> 20s...) until the system stabilizes.
- **Stateless Recovery**: If the server restarts, the monitor immediately resumes tracking from the last logged event.

### 2. Startup Lifecycle
The automation engine is initialized immediately upon application startup. In `app/main.py`:
```python
@app.on_event("startup")
def on_startup():
    # Initializes DB tables & Event Logs
    init_db() 
    # Spawns the autonomous engine as a decoupled background task
    asyncio.create_task(OrchestrationEngine.background_monitor())
```

### 3. Traceability & Integrity
Every decision made by the AI is logged for audit:
- **EventLog**: Tracks every cycle from `STARTED` to `COMPLETED`.
- **Idempotency**: Payouts are tied to unique `claim_id` and `event_id` combinations, ensuring no worker is ever paid twice for the same disruption.

## ⚠️ Error Handling & Response Patterns

Carbon follows a standardized JSON response pattern for all 44 endpoints.

### Success Pattern (200 OK)
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

### Error Pattern (4xx / 5xx)
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "Detailed error explanation",
  "data": null
}
```

#### Common Status Codes:
- `401`: Unauthorized (Invalid or missing JWT).
- `403`: Forbidden (User doesn't have permissions for this resource).
- `404`: Not Found (Worker or Claim ID doesn't exist).
- `422`: Unprocessable Entity (Body failed Pydantic validation).
- `500`: System Failure (Internal logic error).
